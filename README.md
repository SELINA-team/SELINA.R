# SELINA

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

SELINA is a deep learning-based framework for single cell assignment
with multiple references. The algorithm consists of three main steps:
cell type balancing, pre-training and fine-tuning. The rare cell types
in reference data are first oversampled using SMOTE(Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique), and then the reference data is trained with a
supervised deep learning framework using MADA(Multi-Adversarial Domain
Adaptation). An autoencoder is subsquently used to fine-tune the
parameters of the pre-trained model. Finally, the labels from reference
data are transferred to the query data based on the fully-trained model.
Along with the annotation algorithm, we also collect 136 datasets which
were uniformly processed and curated to provide users with comprehensive
pre-trained models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of SELINA from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("SELINA")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SELINA-team/SELINA.R")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(SELINA)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
