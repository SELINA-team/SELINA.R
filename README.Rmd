# SELINA

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

SELINA is a deep learning-based framework for single cell assignment with multiple references. The algorithm consists of three main steps: cell type balancing, pre-training and fine-tuning. The rare cell types in reference data are first oversampled using SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), and then the reference data is trained with a supervised deep learning framework using MADA(Multi-Adversarial Domain Adaptation). An autoencoder is subsquently used to fine-tune the parameters of the pre-trained model. Finally, the labels from reference data are transferred to the query data based on the fully-trained model. Along with the annotation algorithm, we also collect 136 datasets which were uniformly processed and curated to provide users with comprehensive pretrained models.


## Installation

You can install the released version of SELINA from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("SELINA")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SELINA)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
